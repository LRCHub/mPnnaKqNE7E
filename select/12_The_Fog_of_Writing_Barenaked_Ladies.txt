The fog of writing is like the fog war
You lie to yourself and you pretend you can do it so you can do it more
You make things right, you make some sense
You change the names to protect the guilty and you change the tense
Can I change your mind?

This song could be the one
To help you understand everything I've done
Maybe it'll move you and you could see
I've been taking all my time to make the best of me

The proper lighting can make or break a room
So let's bring a wall of LEDs in to illuminate the doom and gloom
We'll let the sun brighten up the space
We'll take time to make sure that every single thing is in its place
Then I'll change your mind

This song could be the one
To help you understand everything I've done
Maybe it'll move you and make you dance
Maybe if I take my time I'll get one more chance to hold your heart
A chance to hold your heart
Not just stop and start
A chance to hold your heart

History's written by the side that wins
They set the scene, tell the story, and determine all the outs and ins
But what goes down when both sides lose?
How will you be represented? Does it matter? Do you get to choose?
I want to change your mind

This song could be the one
To help you understand everything I've done
Maybe It'll move you and you could see
I've been taking all my time to make the best of me
Yeah I've been taking all my time to make the best of me
I've been taking all my time, all my time, all my time
Yeah I've been taking all my time, all my time, all my time
Yeah I've been taking all my time, all my time, all my time,
All my time, all my time, all my time, all my time
